* To do
- another attempt at corfu, using company backends instead of combined capf, and hope it wont lag.
  - failed...  corfu might be good for writing, but for coding, company takes the W (plus lsp-mode is a bitch)
  - maybe consider using corfu only for org and text modes? and having company-mode exclusions?

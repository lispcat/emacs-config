NOTE: modify #'persp-save-state-to-file arg (keep-others-in-non-parametric-file 'yes)

maybe have each persp have its own save file, and when autosaving, save each persp?
maybe have a function to delete a persp from the main autosave file?
- prompt available perspectives from main autosave file, after selection, delete each from file.
